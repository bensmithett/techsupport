## Sending just 1 or 2 photos

- Open **Picasa 3**.
- Click on the photos you want to send. (You can select more than one at a time by pressing `CTRL` and clicking)
- At the bottom centre of the screen, click **Email**
- In the window that pops up, click **Microsoft Outlook** (or **Gmail** if you want to use your Gmail account)

## Sending many (and/or) full quality photos

- Go to your Dropbox folder. It's just another folder (like My Photos), you can get to it by clicking the Dropbox icon or by opening My Computer.

  - If your photos are already in a folder, just copy that folder into the Dropbox folder, or;
  - Make a new folder inside the Dropbox folder (right-click, then select **New > Folder**) and paste your photos in there.

- Now, right-click on the folder you want to share and select **Dropbox > Share link**. This will open up Internet Explorer.
- Click the **Get link** button. This will copy the public link (or you can just grab the link out of the address bar).
- Paste the link in an email and send it to someone!

Now anyone who visits that link will see all the photos that are in your folder.

**Remember: Anything that you share on Dropbox like this is on the public internet and can be seen by anyone who has that link.**

If you want to make something private again, you can either just delete the folder in Dropbox, or...

- Go to [dropbox.com](http://dropbox.com)
- Sign in
- Click **Links** on the left hand side
- Click **Remove** for the folder you want to remove the public link for
