title: Sync the iPod
---

Your computer is the "master copy" of your music library. When you sync to your ipod, it will add & delete songs to make the iPod match what's on your computer.

- Open iTunes
- Plug in the iPod
- When the **iPod** button appears at the top right corner, click it
- Click **Sync** at the bottom right corner.
- When syncing finishes, click the **Eject** symbol on the **iPod** button.

If you haven't opened iTunes for a while and have purchased some music on the iPad in the meantime, the automatic downloads will start when you open iTunes and you'll be able to sync them once they're downloaded.
